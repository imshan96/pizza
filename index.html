      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
      vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
      pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. In Italy,
      pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the
      use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into
      wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. The term pizza was first
      recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern
      Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern
      pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since
      become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular
      foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America
      and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in
      pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery,
      and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas,
      which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven. In
      2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44
      billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[6] Overall, 13% of the U.S.
      population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[7] The
      Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza
      Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with
      headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan
      pizza.[8] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered
      with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed
      dish,[9][10] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's
      list of intangible cultural heritage.[11] Raffaele Esposito is often
      considered to be the father of modern pizza.

      Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age.[23] Records
      of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can
      be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
      soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great
      baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle
      shields[24][25] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils,
      herbs, and cheese.[26][27] An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs
      in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the
      Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their
      tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that
      includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When
      they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by
      Celaeno.[28] The first mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial
      document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a
      payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas
      Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."[29] Modern
      pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th
      or early 19th century.[30] Before that time, flatbread was often topped
      with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain
      when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.[30]
      Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza
      bakeries. A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza,
      pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of
      Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele
      Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of
      the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a
      pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green
      (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then
      named after the Queen,[31] although later research cast doubt on this
      legend.[32] An official letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of
      service" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria
      Brandi.[33] Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in
      the late nineteenth century[34] and first appeared in areas where they
      concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York
      City in 1905.[35] Following World War II, veterans returning from the
      Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a
      ready market for pizza in particular.[36]
